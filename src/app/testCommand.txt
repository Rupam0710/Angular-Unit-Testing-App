5. Matchers in angular unit test case

   What are matchers?
    
   a. Matchers are nothing but compare functions to actually compare the expected and actual result in the test specs
   b. Matchers are javascript function that does a boolean comparision between an actual output and an expected output
   c. There are 2 types of matchers Inbuilt matcher and Custom Matchers.

   d. Inbuilt matchers - matchers which are built in the jasmine framework are called inbuilt matcher.The user can easily use it implicitly.
   ex - toBe , toBeGreaterThan ,toBeGreaterThanOrEqual, toBeLessThanOrEqual ,toBeNull, etc 

   e. Custom Matchers - The matchers which are not present in the inbuilt system library of Jasmine is called as custom matcher. Custom matcher needs to be drfined explicitly().

6. ToBe and ToEqual in-built matcher in angular unit test

   We can use toBe for primitives like string,boolean and number. For everything else we use toEqual
